# Reflect and Update Memory Files

## Context
- Current project: Cloudz.pro (monorepo with git submodules)
- Memory files location: Root `CLAUDE.md`, project-specific `CLAUDE.md` files, and `@doc/` files
- Auto-update rules: Root (10 sessions), Projects (5 sessions)

## Your Task

Perform a comprehensive reflection on this session and update all memory files with key learnings to improve future development workflows.

### 1. Session Analysis
Analyze what happened during this session:
- What went well and what issues occurred
- Critical patterns, workflows, or rules that should be remembered
- Tools, commands, or approaches that were particularly effective
- Mistakes or anti-patterns that should be avoided

### 2. Memory File Updates

Update these memory files with session learnings:

**Root CLAUDE.md**
- Add critical session learnings to existing auto-update rules
- Strengthen workflow instructions that caused issues
- Update commit message standards if needed
- Enhance submodule handling guidance

**Project-Specific CLAUDE.md Files**
- `/api/CLAUDE.md`: Add API-specific learnings and patterns
- `/web-back-office/CLAUDE.md`: Add frontend development insights  
- `/web-portal/CLAUDE.md`: Update if relevant learnings apply

**Documentation Files**
- Update `/doc/git-workflow.md` with improved submodule handling
- Enhance `/doc/development-patterns.md` with new patterns discovered
- Update `/doc/commit-guide.md` if commit issues occurred

### 3. Learning Categories
Focus on these types of learnings:
- **Critical Issues**: Problems that must never happen again
- **Workflow Improvements**: More efficient ways to accomplish tasks
- **Tool Discoveries**: New tools or commands that proved useful
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recurring issues or successful approaches
- **Best Practices**: Proven methods that should be standardized

### 4. Memory Optimization
- Keep all memory files within their specified line limits
- Remove outdated information that's no longer relevant
- Consolidate similar rules into single, clear statements
- Cross-reference detailed information to @doc/ files when needed

### 5. Format for Session Learnings
Add sections like this to memory files:
```
## Session Learnings (Latest: YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Critical**: [Most important issue to avoid]
- **Effective**: [Best practice or tool that worked]
- **Workflow**: [Process improvement discovered]
```

## Requirements
- Be specific and actionable in updates
- Include dates for session learnings (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Focus on preventing recurring issues
- Maintain existing memory optimization rules
- Do NOT include AI attribution in any commit messages

Please proceed with this systematic reflection and memory update process.
